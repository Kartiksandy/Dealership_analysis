## Dealership Analysis

This repository contains two parts of a comprehensive analysis focused on dealership operations. The analysis aims to uncover insights related to sales performance, inventory management, customer behavior, and other key metrics that can drive business decisions.

### Part 1: Initial Data Exploration and Preprocessing
- **Objective:** 
  - To perform an initial exploration of the dataset to understand its structure and contents.
  - To preprocess the data, handling any missing values, outliers, or other anomalies that could impact the analysis.
  
- **Key Steps:**
  1. **Data Loading:** Loading the dataset(s) into the environment.
  2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Conducting basic EDA to summarize the main characteristics of the data.
  3. **Data Cleaning:** Handling missing values, removing duplicates, and addressing outliers.
  4. **Feature Engineering:** Creating new features that could provide additional insights or improve the predictive models.

- **Expected Output:**
  - A cleaned and preprocessed dataset ready for more advanced analysis in Part 2.
  - Initial insights and visualizations that highlight trends or patterns in the data.

### Part 2: Advanced Analysis and Modeling
- **Objective:** 
  - To conduct a deeper analysis using statistical methods and machine learning models.
  - To generate actionable insights that can inform strategic decisions for the dealership.

- **Key Steps:**
  1. **Advanced EDA:** Further exploring the data to identify correlations, segmentations, and other patterns.
  2. **Statistical Analysis:** Applying statistical tests and methods to validate hypotheses and understand relationships within the data.
  3. **Predictive Modeling:** Building machine learning models to predict key outcomes such as sales forecasts, inventory needs, or customer lifetime value.
  4. **Model Evaluation:** Assessing the performance of the models using appropriate metrics and validation techniques.
  5. **Actionable Insights:** Summarizing the findings and providing recommendations based on the analysis.

- **Expected Output:**
  - Detailed reports and visualizations that illustrate the results of the analysis.
  - Predictive models that can be used for future decision-making.
  - Strategic recommendations for improving dealership performance.
